# Redis
This project is a test of redis. You need docker machine to install the light version of redis and it has a custom password
in the docker compose.

Steps to run the project
- Go to terminal. Run docker-compose up.
- Haven't written the custom serializer. Using gson as the serializer for the type.
- Run the project. You should be able to save custom objects to the cache and get them back.

Let me know if any issues or improvements.
